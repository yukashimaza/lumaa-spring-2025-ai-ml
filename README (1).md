Dataset:
I used a dataset called tmdb_5000_movies.xlsx which comes from Kaggle, and you can download from the website: https://www.kaggle.com/code/ibtesama/getting-started-with-a-movie-recommendation-system/input?select=tmdb_5000_movies.csv. You can directly use my dataset thatâ€™s in the repository. I specifically used the columns title and overview for our purpose.

Setup:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn

Running: Run the Recommendation System
python3 /Users/yukashimazaki/Desktop/movie4.py --file /Users/yukashimazaki/Desktop/tmdb_5000_movies.xlsx --query "I love sci-fi action movies set in space."
Please update the location of the py file and the excel file in your local machine.
